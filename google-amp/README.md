# Disqus for Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP)

Disqus for Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) is a fast-loading, optimized Disqus experience for [Google AMP](https://www.ampproject.org/) compatible pages. AMP is a way to build web pages for static content that renders quickly, especially on mobile devices. The Disqus Universal Code can be implemented on an AMP compatible page.

## Before you start
- If you haven't done so already, you'll want to familiarize yourself with Google's [What Is AMP?](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/get_started/about-amp.html) and [Create Your First AMP Page](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/get_started/create.html).
- Make sure you've [registered](https://disqus.com/admin/install/) your site with Disqus. Read the [Quickstart Guide](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466182-quick-start-guide) for more information.
- If you have an existing site on Disqus, you can find your “shortname” in Admin > Settings > [General](https://01298301298.disqus.com/admin/settings/general/).
- Make sure you can host the installation code on two _different_ domains.

## How to install

1. Create and host the following Universal Code file on a different domain than where you intend to load Disqus for AMP. This will be the URL that you will provide to the `src` attribute in step 3 below.

    ```html
    <div id="disqus_thread"></div>
    <script>
    window.addEventListener('message', receiveMessage, false);
    function receiveMessage(event)
    {
        if (event.data) {
            var msg;
            try {
                msg = JSON.parse(event.data);
            } catch (err) {
                // Do nothing
            }
            if (!msg)
                return false;

            if (msg.name === 'resize') {
                window.parent.postMessage({
                  sentinel: 'amp',
                  type: 'embed-size',
                  height: msg.data.height
                }, '*');
            }
        }
    }
    </script>
    <script>
        /**
         *  RECOMMENDED CONFIGURATION VARIABLES: EDIT AND UNCOMMENT THE SECTION BELOW TO INSERT DYNAMIC VALUES FROM YOUR PLATFORM OR CMS.
         *  LEARN WHY DEFINING THESE VARIABLES IS IMPORTANT: https://disqus.com/admin/universalcode/#configuration-variables
         */
        var disqus_config = function () {
            this.page.url = window.location;  // Replace PAGE_URL with your page's canonical URL variable
            this.page.identifier = window.location.hash; // Replace PAGE_IDENTIFIER with your page's unique identifier variable
        };
        (function() {  // DON'T EDIT BELOW THIS LINE
            var d = document, s = d.createElement('script');

            s.src = '//EXAMPLE.disqus.com/embed.js';

            s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date());
            (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s);
        })();
    </script>
    ```

2. Refer to the `amp-iframe` [documentation](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/extended/amp-iframe.html) and add the required `amp-iframe` script to your document's `<head>`. :
    
    ```html
    <script async custom-element="amp-iframe" src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0/amp-iframe-0.1.js"></script>

    ```

3. Place the following `<amp-iframe>` element anywhere within the <body> of your AMP page. It will likely make sense to place it at the end of your article content, where ever you would your audience should engage further after reading.

    ```html
    <amp-iframe width=600 height=140
                layout="responsive"
                sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-modals allow-popups allow-forms"
                resizable
                src="https://example.com/amp#hash">
    </amp-iframe>
    ```

4. Replace `hash` with a unique identifier that represents the page where you’d like a specific thread to display. If you are loading the `<amp-iframe>` element on multiple pages, generate the `hash` dynamically for each page. The hash you provide will be used in the `identifier` and `url` variables in step 1.
5. Add the new domain as a Trusted Domain in your Admin > Settings > [Advanced](https://disqus.com/admin/settings/advanced/).
